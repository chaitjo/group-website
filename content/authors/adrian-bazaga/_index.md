Hi! I'm Adrián, an AI Scientist at Microsoft, where I work on empowering agentic AI experiences on Copilot+ devices for millions of users worldwide, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs).

Also, I'm a PhD in Machine Learning student at the University of Cambridge, where I conduct research under the supervision of Prof. Pietro Liò and Prof. Gos Micklem. My research has been published in leading Machine Learning conferences such as ICLR, ICML, and EMNLP, as well as Nature journals. 

Previously, I gained research experience through internships at Microsoft Research and Amazon AGI, where I explored novel training schemes to enhance few-step generation in diffusion models, and test-time scaling for temporal reasoning with LLMs. Prior to that, I spent ~5 years in various startups, working at the intersection of AI and biology.
